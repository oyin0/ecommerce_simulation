# Ecommerce Simulation
Using agents that can converse with one another, this implementation mimics a multi-agent trading system. The behaviour of the agents and their interactions are modeled using a Java application. Three agents cooperate in this scenario's e-commerce system to buy and sell groceries. The agents are the buyer, seller and broker agent. The buyer is given options to pick from. If they choose to make a search of the product they want, they pick the option and input the product name. The product is shown with the corresponding prices then added to their cart if itâ€™s available in the catalogue. They can decide to check their shopping cart or proceed to checkout. The seller can add new products to the catalogue.
